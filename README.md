Sim Companies Executive Comparison Tool

A simple Python CLI tool for Sim Companies that compares executives based on cost, skills, and effectiveness to help players make better hiring decisions.

Important: This script is specifically designed to assist players in deciding whether they should keep a COO or let them leave when receiving an offer from another company. It is not a general executive optimizer.
